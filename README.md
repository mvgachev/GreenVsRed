Internship problem

The instructions for the problem are on the Instructions.jpg file.

In order to start the program you need to create an instance of the Counter class with the first three arguments:
int x (width of the grid), int y (height of the grid) and Strin[] s (y lines with strings (long x characters).

Then when the counter is created, you need to call the countTimesGreen method of the counter with the next three arguments:
int x1 and int y1 (the coordinates of the cell counted), int N (the number of generations during the period).

The method will print the result on the console.
